You are Robert Falcon Scott, intrepid Polar explorer and all round tough guy. You're British and play Cricket & Polo. It's vital that to sustain your air of superiority, you must keep a stiff upper lip at all times!
Back at the turn of the Century - that's the 19th Century, you gained worldwide fame with your Discovery Expedition, scoring a new world record for the southernmost point reached; 82 degrees South. Crikey!

But that's not enough for you,  you're hard as nails. So to prove it, you've embarked on a second expedition - the Terra Nova. Objective; to be the first person to reach the South Pole. It doesn't get much cooler than that!

And here you are at the South Pole! It's January 17th 1912. What an amazing achievement! You take lots of photos, and selfies, posing with your flag pole and your buddy Captain Oats.

But wait! Something is wrong. Very wrong. What! That upstart, whippersnapper Roald Amundsen has already been here. Four weeks ago!! How dare he! The total cad. The bounder. You are incandescent with rage. How dare he take the priority. He's stolen your thunder, your fame, your glory. How are you going to strut about like a big nob after this embarrassment.

Your stiff upper lip begins to quiver a bit. But after several large swigs of brandy, a cunning plan starts to form in your mind…

*page_break

The world does not yet know of Amundsen's achievement. He'll be on his way back,  most probably at an easy pace. Suppose, you were to _race_ back and reach civilisation _before_ Amundsen?

You would announce your achievement, reaching the South Pole, but not mention anything about Amundsen. This being the first news would spread like wildfire. Instant fame and glory. By the time Amundsen gets back, the news will be old. People will have heard it all already, the _minor_ fact that he was _actually_ first will be overshadowed and probably relegated to the back pages in Norwegian. No one would see it. Of course not.

*page_break

Let's take stock. You and Oatsey will take the best sled with the fastest huskies and the minimum of supplies. The others will trail behind.  You'll be a bit short of supplies, but with luck you'll be able to uncover the supply caches you left on the way out.

You'll bring just your hip flask of brandy, to help maintain a stiff upper lip. This you'll refill from the supply caches as well. Oatsey can get his own.

You'll work your huskies hard, but be careful not to overdo it. Can't have them dying on you; not until you get home anyhow. You'll have to camp from time to time, but try to get as many miles behind you each day.

Any other problems, just wing it.

but above all _do not let Amundsen catch up under any circumstances_.

Ok, ready? 

*page_break Let's go!

    Congratulations!
    You **WIN**! You made it to civilisation before that _whippersnapper_ Amundsen! The press lap up news of your Polar success, overshadowing the _minor_ fact that you didn't, in fact, _actually_ get to the South Pole first.
    You're even more famous, get another medal, and generally strut about like you're the expert on everything!
