1.	compress pictures by logging in as 'graphics',
	going to game/c64 and typing 'piccom64 *.c64'
	move .fin files into working directory

2.	make cameos.
	cat cameos together in picture order into file
	cameos in working directory

3.	make text
	log in as common, go to working directory and
	type 'dotext64 ~game/text/game.text'
	'mv treepage.i ~elthamr/common'

4.	Assemble eltham with C64 set to TRUE.
	type 'lf prog code > /dev/null' to extract the code section
	move 'code' to working directory
	go there and type :
		ecomp NN code > ~elthamr/common/numperm.i
	where NN is the number of pages of eltham which must be
	permanent (in hex).
	Type 'ecrypt code.perm code.rest'

5.	Go to wherever the 6502 hangs out & type 'make'
	copy xeq to the working directory
	create a text file with what you want to appear on the screen
	as it is loading
	type 'makeboot64 title xeq' where title is the text file
	'mv result GAME'

6.	Create a file in the working directory called 'files'
	the first lines of 'files' should be :
		/usr/adv/advdir/c64bits/asm/fdisk.o,0
		code.rest.cr,1
		text,1
		tree,1
		cameos,1
		code.perm.cr,2,34
	and the rest of the lines should be the names of the .fin
	compressed picture files in the order which the game expects them.
	finally add lines onto the end of the file :
		GAME,dos
		GCOPY,dos
		GMC,dos
	type 'mkdisk64 files DISK1 DISK2'

7.	Switch on the BEEB and C128 and connect the two with the
	really dodgy looking cable.
	Take 2 blank disks and format them on the C128 with the
	ID bytes for disk one and disk two of the game resp.
	insert the disk label C64 UTILS into the C128 drive
	and type 'DLOAD"LOADIMAGE"' then 'RUN'
	insert the disk formatted to be disk one.
	log in as common on the BEEB and cd to the working directory.
	type CTRL-BREAK then 'BASIC'
	type 'CH."RELAYIM"'
	type 'DISK1'
	press a key on the beeb and c128.
	wait.
	type RUN on the beeb
	insert the C64 UTILS disk into the C128 and type RUN
	insert the disk formatted to be disk two into the C128
	type 'DISK2' on the beeb
	press a key on the beeb and c128.
	wait.
	hold down the commodore key on the C128 and press reset.
	type 'LOAD"GAME",8,1'

8.	Hope.
