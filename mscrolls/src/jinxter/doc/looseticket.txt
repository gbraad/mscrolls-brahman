Loosing ticket

After you bought a ticket from the stationmaster with one-ferg, the wind keeps blowing the ticket away. Because of the train timer, we need to shortcut the puzzle assistant to do a "get ticket" directly while hunting for it. To recognize the scene in the puzzle assistant, we keep the looseticketstate (originally it is cleared)
