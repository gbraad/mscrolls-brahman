Luck

If you lose some of your luck during the game, you can't win anymore, but won't notice until the endgame.

Idea:
Decrement the luck, but use it only as additional scoring. If you have scored all points and kept all your luck -> different ending where you survive. The access to the endgame is allowed regardless of the „luck“ - you always choose the right door

### different ending has to be added

setmode.asm:

	MOVE.W	D1,D2				; d1 => target room.
	CALL	DoExploredRoom			; ne => been here.
	BNE.S	25$				; tut tut shouldn't come

->		BRA.S	10$		; in remaster mode always select the right door
->	ENDC 
	CMP.W	#4,LUCK_(A4)			;Got all you're luck?
	BEQ.S	10$				;=> yep
