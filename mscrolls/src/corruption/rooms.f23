Compared to your old office this isn't much of an improvement. You wonder
whether it was worth accepting the partnership when you still have the same

her office next door and, on first impressions, she isn't much of an
improvement either. The only consolation is the splendid view of the square out
of your window

room main_rest "le Monaco restaurant" {
	desc {
Secluded alcoves on raised levels give the mainly business clientele of Le
Monaco ample chance to discuss financial matters out of earshot of their 
competitors. A door leads to the kitchens, where the chefs prepare their superb
meals

room alcove "alcove" {
	desc {
Before your promotion this was your lucky alcove as so many deals were clinched
here over coffee after a particularly delicious meal, your clients only too
happy to sign any contract you cared to put in front of them in the hope of 
being invited to indulge themselves again. When seated at the table, dimly 
illuminated and surrounded by large plants, your view of other alcoves is 
obscured and only the main floor of the restaurant is visible down a couple of
steps to the south

# This is the fodded description of the kitchen which is now 'spareroom' below
#
# Like all restaurant kitchens this is not as clean as it could be. The vast
# range used by the chefs could almost be considered antique and the copper
# pots and pans are so battered as to seem useless. However, recalling the
# delights that come from this kitchen you accept that these must be the
# implements with which the chefs can most ably create their masterpieces.
# Opposite the door which leads into the main restaurant is the back door,
# next to a huge worktable on which all the food is prepared before
# cooking begins


room casino "casino" {
	desc {
This casino is packed with glamorous gamblers, cheerfully handing chips over
as they inevitably lose. The occasional win is greeted by cheers and a round of
applause. Baccarat, trente-et-quarante, blackjack and roulette are all
catered for and a private room through a padded door can be hired for other
games. Standing next to the teller's counter is a large bouncer, waiting to
step in if any trouble ensues over transactions

A heavy carpet of cigar smoke hangs in mid-air in this plush private room.
Three men are playing poker, two of them looking nervously at a bald one as the
stakes get higher and higher. A tough henchman stands by the door keeping an
eye on the money

room pharmacy "pharmacy" {

Behind the prescription counter of this small pharmacy stands the chemist,
dutifully making up prescriptions as he has done for the last thirty years.
Despite its size, the pharmacy stocks a staggering range of items, all
stacked neatly on shelves that stretch high up to the ceiling

room yard "back yard" {

All the restaurant's rubbish from the past month seems to have been dumped
here; dustbins are full to overflowing, a moss-covered drainpipe spills
straight onto the cobbles and a pile of sacks and boxes stacked next to a
wooden door looks as if it will topple at any moment. The only exit apart from
the wooden door to the casino is into the kitchen through the back door
