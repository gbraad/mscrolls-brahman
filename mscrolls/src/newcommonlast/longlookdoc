* Long Lists
* Longlists is a mechanism by which the name of an object can be 
* modified by an additional piece of descripive text appended to the
* name.
*  Because this text may be used within a list, it should have no
* punctuation at the end, whense messages can be strung together with
* commas.
* The text modifier can optionally be included in the main description
* of the object(s) in question. constructed as an extra sentence on the
* end of the main description.
*
* eg.
* >look
* The tea lady is dancing the waltz.		; is constructed by
*
* [A tea lady] [isare] "dancing the waltz" [FULLSTOP]
*
* by setting, 'isare' mode
* Note: Full stops are generated automatically.
*
* messages are automatically factored if they apply to more than one
* object being listed.
* so for example, the following text may be produced;

* >look
* A unicorn is dancing the waltz, a pelican is pecking the wall and a 
* ticket and a paddle are bobbing up and down in the water here.

* Note, the two consecutive 'and's produced by nested lists.

Routines:

EntryLongLook

* make an entry in the LongLookTable
* Entry
*	d1.L = entry (HI=scen#, LO=noun#)

 This puts D1.L into the LongLookTable
at the first avaliable blank space after the label:
	LongLookTable.Blank

it is intended that there are about ten,
	DC.L	0
here as to make enough room, excessive use of entrylonglook
rotates the table, so that the earliest entry 'falls off' the beginning.

FodLongLook

* Entry;
*	D0.W = item to fod

 Fods the first longlook entry for the item in D0.W

FodLongLooks

* entry;
* 	D0.W = item to fod.

Fods all the longlookentries for the item in d0.W

 and in scenrw.i the table;

*********************************************************
*
* LongLookTable
*
* Format of table:
*
*	DC.W	scen msg# [+HI] [+BIT14], noun# [+ HI]
*	DC.W	...
*	DC.L	0
*
* The nouns wi this message are factored in the list
* and printed as a group wi the one message.
* If the scenario msg is hi-bit set, then the 'isare' is suppressed between
* the name of the objet and the modifying text.
* If the msg# is BIT14 set, then the modifying text is NOT produced 
* when the object is LOOKed at.
