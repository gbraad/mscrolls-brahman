## Release Notes:

Version: 1.1.02/1.11, for SpringThing 2021.

## About the Game:

Each time you play, the game picks a new villain! So the murderer can be different every time. Be advised, if you refresh the browser page, it will restart the game!

This game uses a mixture of Choice + Parser text input, so this is a bit different than most players are used to. I'm interested in whether this "works".

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Christopher Merriner for beta test.

## Known Problems:

* virtual keyboard does not pop-up on mobile devices.
* Text appears blobby on Firefox if `privacy.resistFingerprinting` has been set.
* No audio in Chrome mobile. Apparently this is due to default autoplay disabled.
