## How to Play

Click [here](https://stvle.s3.amazonaws.com/picton/index.html) (and wait 10 seconds!)

**Please do not share this link during beta!**


## Beta Notes:

This is a beta for SpringThing 2021!

This is a new game with a new engine! You can play the game directly in a browser. You need a fairly up-to-date browser.

All bugs, comments and suggestions gratefully received!

A big **thank you!** to everyone helping to test, I'll put your name in the game credits (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

## About the Game:

Each time you play, the game picks a new villain! So the murderer can be different every time. Be advised, if you refresh the browser page, it will restart the game!

This game uses a mixture of Choice + Parser text input, so this is a bit different than most players are used to. I'm interested in whether this "works".

## Reporting Bugs & Suggestions

There can be problems either in the _system_, such as "the text appears blobby" or in the _story_, such as grammatical errors, issues with the story or things that don't work right in the game world.

Please can you supply the version numbers when reporting problems, as this is really helpful;

When you first run the game you should see a paragraph,
