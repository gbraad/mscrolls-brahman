STORY
Major Stephenson has been shot dead in his study!

You are the indomitable Inspector Lance Picton, who gets the cases no one else can solve. Your tenacious approach to detail consistently nails the guilty.

You've already figured out that exactly one member of the household is guilty. The Suspects are: Charles, Major Stephenson's brother and business partner, Charlotte the Major's wife, Jimmy the son or possibly Jeeves the family butler. 

BEGIN
\nSpringThing 2021 Edition. Please send any feedback to sia@9ize.com Thanks!
\n\nYou arrive at the manor entrance where Sergeant Bulwark is currently posted.
\n\n" 'ello Inspector," he says in his usual acerbic manner, "We got a right one 'ere! We had that numpty detective Hazelden round earlier. He poked around, got absolutely nowhere. What a fool, he even suggested that the butler did it; does he think this is some kind of game!
\nAnyway, we saw 'im off and called you in. I've had all the suspects stay right 'ere in the 'ouse for questioning." GOODWORK
"When you've rumbled it, come back 'ere 'an I'll nab 'im. Or her, that is!"
\nWith that, the sergeant thumps his fist on the door, which flies open revealing a flustered butler.

He's about 10 years old, wearing a maroon V-neck wool jumper and grey schoolboy shorts. Despite being born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he still manages to somehow look scruffy. Piecing, piggy blue eyes stare back at you fiercely. You get the impression he totally despises the police and you in particular. He's probably guilty as Hell!
