  Rebuild and test jinxter_256.nex and jinxter_512.nex until working.
  Test by loading bug.SAV and entering command "melt plastic key with candle".

* Create videos.

* Toggle graphics on/off with right mouse button or GRAPH key?

* A0E9 in do_line_a() can be optimized. Not used in pawn/guild/jinxter.
