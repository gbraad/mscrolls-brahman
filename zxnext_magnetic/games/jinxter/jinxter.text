Two rows of seats separated by a narrow central aisle run the length of this traditionally malodorous bus. It's no Rolls-Royce, but then neither are you. There's a sign behind the driver's booth and a set of automatic doors allows you on and off the bus. Mounted above the doors is a button

The typical kitchen of one who cannot or will not cook. A table stands in the centre of the room, and a fridge in the corner hums quietly to itself (and indeed to anyone else who'll listen).

One of your fantasies is that you are an austere and ascetic monk, everyday needs pared down to a bare minimum, and your bedroom has been artfully designed to nurture this pleasing image. There's not a picture or a rug in sight; a simple wooden bed and a plain wardrobe are the entire contents of the room.

"Small, but cramped" best describes this room, lined with [bookshelves](look bookshelves) and overshadowed by a vast and ancient desk at which you claim to work (an obvious lie, since the desk is piled high with magazines). Everyone knows that what your really do is sit here and pretend to be Sherlock Holmes or possibly Professor Moriarty, depending on your mood.

Only a fool would build a north-facing conservatory in the northern hemisphere, but who said we are in the northern hemisphere? Who even said what planet this is? Anyway, glass is cheaper than bricks, and the conservatory is a delightful place to sit in your wicker chair at your wicker table and gaze admiringly at your vicious cacti, lining the glass wall in potfuls. Your library is south of here, your kitchen west, and the back door leads north to the garden

Friends who come to dinner love this comforting, warm hallway; a good thing, since you are a lousy cook. You love it too, and shed the cares of the outside world every time you come in. Broad and spacious, it forks northwest into the bedroom and northeast to the library; your heavy front door shuts out the rough old world to the south
As we said, it's frightening
Knee-deep in absurdly lush grass, your eyes dazzled by bright blue cornflowers, you potter aimlessly around this rich pasture, wondering whether to investigate the dense wood which lies to the south, the orchard (southeast of here) or the country lane to the west
What we have here is a warm ton of raw beef covered in hair and nurturing a grievance. Not cosy at all
Drooling with indignation, the defeated bull wanders aimlessly around in circles, blinded by the red tablecloth covering his [head]
hangs in tatters on the bull's horns
Mighty oaks sough in the languid wind and a golden field lies south, while to the north you can see a broad pasture. The lane winds to the northwest, and, beyond a vicious barbed wire fence, there appears to be a way eastwards
sway gently in the wind
used to be live flies, but that was before they died; before that, they were maggots, and before that, eggs.  In any [case], they are disgusting, and there are thousands and thousands of them. How horrid
This garish yellow field is a blot on the landscape. What's more, the mustard seeds flying on the wind are making your nose run and your eyes [water]. If you had a slice of cold roast beef you'd be in clover. (At least, you'd be in mustard, which is the same as being in clover where beef is concerned). Since you haven't got any beef, you'd best run north or east, though watch out for the barbed wire fence
The barbed-wire fence is one of the ones which you can't climb over and you can't crawl through, which is why it was chosen in the first place
Xam's infamously barmy gardener, known and hated throughout the county, has been comparatively restrained here; it's just a standard, lush, green orchard, bounded on the west by a barbed-wire fence, and a grassy field lies northwest. You can hear the murmuring of a spring to the east. A bridge leads southeast, and Xam's front garden lies south
Oojimy something
The clock tower lies east, a door leads northeast to the carousel, and, last but not least, a small workshop lies [west]. It's worth noting that the small workshop is blazing away merrily
This cool spring, surrounded on all sides but the west by steep banks, bubbles up from underground. It looks entirely artless and natural, belying the fact that Xam's crazed gardener constructed it by means of an intricate system of dams and hydraulics, initially flooding half the neighbourhood and leading to a series of acrimonious lawsuits lasting several years. It is nevertheless his favourite spot
This dreadful structure is a danger to life and limb. The mad gardener cherishes it, of course. The orchard is northwest, and there's a crumbling shed to the south, but don't pay any attention now: just try and stay alive
was clearly designed by a madman, and only a madman would use it
A colourful riot of flowers, carefully tended by Xam's colourful, riotous gardener, lines the gravel path leading southwest to his kitchen door. North leads back to the orchard
Which path do you mean, the On the Path, the On the Path or the On the Path? (An old joke for old customers. Actually, the path is well-debugged and there's nothing odd about it.)

Damned place is a shambles. Shocking! Rubbish all over the floor, empty cartons and packets, definitely needs a woman's touch but all it's got is the mad gardener's touch and a trapdoor in the [floor]. Northeast takes you back to the garden, and an exit leads west; frankly, either direction would be a relief

Well... it's a stick of wax with a wick up it. Painful business, being a candle
Xam's father gazes calmly out at you: one of the old school of Green magicians, humorous, capricious, much given to jokes, but essentially benign
Another scruffy room. Boy, is this guy a slob. Dust lies thickly on the set of Encyclopaedia Aquitania filling the bookshelves, and a crufty table sits in the corner. The dining room is north, and a door leads southwest into the garden
What you do is sit on the benches and drink a lot of beer and then you fall off the benches. Orthodox, true, but fun
A vast and costly partwork of half-truths sold to the incorrigibly ignorant by the invincibly persuasive on impossibly easy terms

A tiny trapdoor, barely large enough to squeeze through, has been set into the floor; from around its edges leaks a stench you could hang your hat on
The reason for the slightly difficult smell escaping from this cellar is easily traceable to a large oak vat filled with fermenting goo.  Either Xam or the mad gardener has a truly antisocial hobby. The trapdoor leads back up
is indescribably disgusting
is tiny, no bigger than a match box
This thing could light up your life
You know what they say - paddle your own canoe
This is where Xam grows his, um, medicinal, er, herbs. And so forth. His house is northeast, and a colossal holly bush stands to your south
is green and prickly. With little berries. The berries are red
Old Mother Nature, instinct in her creation, gazes blandly back at you
Ouch! You have just walked into a prickling mass of holly dripping with crimson berries.  You can escape these evergreen prickles by going north. Through the dark greenery you spy a nerdulent magpie, whistling cheerfully

extends from a greenish wrist; both of which are the colour and texture of old mouldy pizza, enough to give anyone the willies
In its heyday, this great door slid open to allow the passage of boats to and from the boathouse; now it is neglected and peeling, and its runners are rusty
look particularly rusty
The icy lagoon lies to the south of this little jetty, while north leads back into the boathouse
The mad gardener uses this speedy, lightweight canoe when he goes out at night to shoot fish. There is a small hole just below the waterline
Having whetted his appetite by mucking around with streams and rivers, the crazed gardener was moved to divert the course of the sea itself. This lagoon is one result of his megalomania, the other consequences being too grotesque and awful to describe here. The end result, however, is certainly attractive: blue, chill [waters](go down) stretch out around and beneath you; to the south lies the ornamental pagoda, to the southwest lies the great conifer wood, while away to the north is the little jetty where the canoe was moored
is engrossed in his work
Xam's grandfather, High Master of the Order of Green Magic, built this great folly as a meeting-place for the Green Witches. The status that the Order once enjoyed is symbolised by the monumental style of the building. From here you could cross the lagoon northwards to the mooring. However, darkened steps lead invitingly down
These great steps of finest Carrara marble lead up to the pagoda, while a passageway leads east

You are beneath the lagoon in a long corridor, which rather gives you the willies, what with the sound of lapping water, the cheery song of fishes outside and so forth. You can, if you wish, descend even [deeper](go down), or return westwards to the airlock
Here was once the robing-room, it seems, for the Green Witches' lodge meetings. Judging by the swivel chair and desk, it's now used as an office. A red painted door leads east, or you could go back up to the corridor

This is a large, circular, steel chamber with a control panel set into the wall, a fearsome-looking door leading east and a hatch [above] you
The gloom here is so intense that you can hardly make out the weed waving in front of your face; a gentle current tempts you northwest, but you can smootly slide in almost any direction: northeast, north, northwest, southwest, south, southeast, east and up
This was the meeting-place for the Order of Green Witches, a great green circular chamber with an ornate ceiling from which hangs a great Gothic chandelier. The only exit from here is [back](go west) into the sacristy

The air here is heavy and resinous from the closely-planted conifers which almost obscure the sky. To the south lies the village green, while through the trees to the northeast you glimpse blue [waters]
The focal point of the village, this cheerful green is a hive of activity when the fair comes to town. This time of year though, things are a little more low-key, and the folk busy themselves about more mundane matters like eating and drinking. The route to the north leads back towards the wood and a magnificent carousel can be seen over to the southwest. The usual assortment of village shops skirt the green, serving the needs of the local populace. To the [northeast](NE) is the [entrance](do post door) to a typical country post office, while a [bakery](look bakery) and the obligatory village [pub](look pub) stand on opposite sides of the green to the northwest and southeast
Although northeast leads you back to the village green; and although an ancient [clockmaker's] shop and a looming tower stand to the [southwest](SW), here is a place to linger.

How tempting a prospect, with its great  calliope waiting to blare out majestic  band music to accompany you on your journey

A tremendous and irresistible symphony of aromas - freshly-baked bread, hot chocolate, dried fruit and spices - seduces you into this bakery. A notice is stuck to the wall with blobs of lemon curd. The village green lies southeast, and wooden steps lead down

Looking at the wall is really incredibly thrilling. You stare at it in mute wonder, recalling walls you have known since your earliest days, walls you learned of at your grandmother's knee, walls fabled in song and legend, and distant, mythical walls whose existence is only hinted at by ancient sages. Thinking on the role of walls in your life, you eventually enter a trance-like state which the mystics of the Orient call "Nirvana" and the rest of us call "idiocy". You might as well [bang your head](bang head on wall) on the wall for all the good it'll do you
That would take more than contortion
This narrow passage runs eastwards into a small room of little intrinsic architectural interest and continues westwards
is like a colossal steel bathplug sealing off the eastern rooms from the airlock itself. Where the chain would go, there's a large wheel instead
Once the door is closed this wheel tightens the lock making the door [water] tight. [Turning it](turn wheel) locks and unlocks the [door]
You are swimming about aimlessly underwater. \_Bloop... bloop... bloop..._\ But you can smootly slide in any direction: northeast, north, northwest, west, southwest, south, southeast, east and up
Watery sunshine filters feebly through the lagoon, faintly illuminating a hatch [below](go down) you. And you can smootly slide in any direction: northeast, north, northwest, west, southwest, south, southeast, east, up and down
Peering about the lagoon, you try to work out where you are, but your sense of direction seems to have let you down

You are floating about high above the Green Witches' meeting chamber. Rumour has it that they were able to do the same thing - without the water. The Green Lodge  lies  [below](go down). The chandelier is well within reach from here 
Typical of many a country Post Office, this small shop houses only the essentials of its trade. Plain wooden floorboards cover the floor and a counter spans the width of the room. A simple pair of scales stand behind the counter and a safe has been set in the rear wall. Above the door, to the southwest, hangs a small bell

Crafted from three-inch case-hardened steel and endorsed by seventy-two inch case-hardened coppers, this Chugg "Champion" Twin-Key Wonder has four [handles](look handles), one at each corner, and a plaque bearing the Chugg trademark of a weeping burglar

is a massive, Gothic, brass job which in its heyday would have held several hundred candles. Now it is dark and tarnished
The chandelier, viewed from close to, is not only badly tarnished, but smudged with large, earthy thumbprints
A slight current here nudges you gently northwards; it might be worth following it; but but you can also smootly slide in any other direction: northeast, northwest, west, southwest, south, southeast, east and up
Dimly visible in the watery light of the lagoon, the carcass of a wrecked ship looms [below](go down) you, its ribs and masts like bleached bones in the water's relentless drift. But you can also slide in any other direction: northeast, north, northwest, west, southwest, south, southeast, east and up
The rotted hull of this immemorial wreck heaves and groans in the current. [Above](go up) you shimmers the light of the lagoon

A stone pulls up alongside you. You realise that the stone is precisely what you are dropping like
A heavy hemisphere of thick, iridescent glass rests upon a massive immovable [base](do dome) to which it is locked by what appears to be a system of really tacky, cheap sliding plastic [blocks](do block). Probably if you had a sword it would be glowing blue at this point, but you haven't, so what the hell?

The platform continues north and south here. The railway tracks lie east, while, beyond them, is another platform, facing this one. Steps lead up to a bridge provided for passengers who wish to cross the tracks
This is the northern end of the platform. The tracks curve around to lie to to the north of the platform, which also continues south.  A door marked \_"Private"_\ leads off to the [west](W)
Regular users of the \_Mountain Loop Railway_\ may laugh at the notion that a [train] may come along at any moment and flatten you. However, the fact remains that a train may come along at any moment and flatten you.  Perhaps you had better go south back to the platform before you go [south] for the winter - \_permanently_\
The Postal Depot was intended as a storage and collection point for postal packages, but has been turned into a general dumping-ground for all the stationmaster's junk, an extraordinary collection of which is lying all around the room. To the east you get back to the platform
This old, rotted rope is attached to the wooden hatch. Looks like you pull on the rope to get the food in the hatch. If there were any food in the hatch, that is. Anyway, you get the picture

This old buffer has, after years of contact with trains, become at least 50% train himself, as is obvious from the way he steams and puffs and whistles his way around his domain

The locomotive clings perilously to the single rail track which winds, almost vertically, around the mountain side. Far below, you can see the station, while the summit of the mountain rises high into the sky above
Harold Lloyd used to do his own stunts from choice. You cannot afford that level of choice. You can just about reach the carriage window from here. Are you more likely to kill yourself climbing in, or staying [up] here clinging on? It's your choice. You're on your own, buster
Try as you might, your eyes refuse to focus on anything more complicated than your nose. However, through this blurred vision, you can just see two figures bending over you; at least one of which looks vaguely familiar. The atmosphere is thick with a strange antiseptic odour and a machine, at the bedside, makes bleeping noises at annoyingly erratic intervals

Cramped and bone-shaken in this tiny, pungent oubliette, you lose track of time altogether
You cling on desperately, retaining your grip against all odds
You are clinging perilously to the roof of the train. Its grubby, smoke-stained surface offers an insecure grip. Below you, you can just make out a window
You are on the bridge running east to west between the two platforms; below you run the railway tracks
There's nothing more depressing than a disused railway platform.  Rank weeds straggle between the cracked flagstones and an air of gloom and desolation infects this gloomy place. The other platform can be reached by going up onto the bridge

This grandiose and boastful tower attempts to reach the sky
This passage is so narrow that one man could easily block it; a design feature, presumably. It leads west to the great archway, and continues downward from here
This small, warm room is so cosy that you would hardly believe that it was regarded with dread by centuries of prisoners and malfeasants. A splintered but stout door leads north, and the narrow passageway runs upwards from here
is nasty, brutish and short, depraved by the usages of his grim trade
This splintery but obviously solid door can only be opened from the gaoler's side
The inner hatch is designed to allow the prisoner to get at his food. Rumour has it that you'd be better off eating the hatch rather than the food, but it looks as though you would have difficulty lifting it, let alone eating it
The outer hatch opens onto the kitchen. When the grandees had finished gobbling in the hall, the swill and scraps would have been passed through the hatch into the dumb waiter, ready for the prisoner to collect
This huge grim grey, granite kitchen reeks of ancient cabbage, pig-fat and gravy, despite the industrial-sized fan hanging from the ceiling. A wooden hatch is set into the south [wall], and a staircase, thick with years of grease and shiny with scullions' footsteps, leads upwards to the Hall
You are compressed like toothpaste in a tube into this pigswill-stinking compartment between two hatches, one inner hatch leading to the dungeon, the other outer hatch to a kitchen. In the good old days, at this point, a prisoner would have flung open the hatch and eaten you
This high, clerestoried vault is illuminated partly by the light streaming through the windows, but, more spectacularly, by the golden radiance streaming from a glass dome in the room's centre. The Tetragrammaton lies west of here
The Green Witch Jannedor is not a pretty sight; witches, however, rarely are, so you are not surprised. The greenish-livid tinge of her skin does not invite closer contact

A real stroke of bad luck, that business with Mrs. What's-her-name and your car. Who would have thought that a trolley-load of budget dog-food could cause so much damage? And what was the old bag doing with budget dog-food anyway, when all she has is a budgie? Maybe she thought it said "budgie dog-food", but who would feed a budgie food made from dogs? Barmy, twisted old Mrs. What's-her-name, probably. Never mind. At least you caught the [bus].~~A stroke of good luck, the [bus]; the walk home can seem endless, and of course it's bound to rain. Funny how good luck is getting rarer and bad luck more frequent, these days. Perhaps these weird \_Green Magicians_\ have got something to do with it. On the whole, though, you reckon it's all idle gossip. You decide to be philosophical and not think about it. Best to try and stay upright (no [seats] available, as usual) and look forward to getting back home to your garden, your books and a spot of peace and quiet...~~~\#[J](){color:red}#[I](){color:orchid}#[N](){color:green}#[X](){color:goldenrod}#[T](){color:blue}#[E](){color:crimson}#[R](){color:orange}\.

You beat a hasty retreat as the heat of the flames scorches your face.
The bus makes an unscheduled stop to allow a [ticket] inspector aboard. He begins to examine the passengers' tickets as the [bus] drives off again.
You are already.
^As you step outside your candle blows out.
You'd get torn to pieces on the barbed wire!
Carefully, you pick your way through the cut strands.
With the gloves protecting your hands, you can grasp the barbed wire quite comfortably.
Realising that the barbs are designed to slice through unprotected human skin, you change your mind. 
You almost cut through the wire but drop the secateurs; as you bend down to retrieve them, the last strand breaks and the taut wire whips back, exactly at the spot where your head would have been a split second before. Someone, or something, is looking after you... but for how long?
The secateurs are blunt!
You snip through each strand in turn, your grasp preventing the wire from lashing about.
The barbed wire fence has been cut, and is lying slack enough for you to pass safely.
^You hear a knock at the kitchen door.
^The sounds of irritable mumbling can be heard from outside the kitchen door.
^The mumbling and footsteps shuffle off into the distance.
The hot plastic moulds itself to the contours of the lock. As it cools the key becomes hard once more, and, with a quick twist, the mailbox springs open.
You force the warm key into the lock with some degree of success. Unfortunately, the plastic hardens too quickly and the key becomes jammed. Perhaps if the key was that little bit warmer things might have been different. But it isn't, and they aren't.
After an age, the telephone is answered. You explain to the voice at the other end about the missed delivery. "Ah yes," says the voice, "poor old Lebling's round. I'll get him to call back immediately." There's a click, and the line goes dead.
The steady 'Number Unobtainable' tone is all you get.
After an interminable number of rings, you give up.
All you get is an engaged tone. You probably dialled the wrong number.
"Yes? Emergency Services? We know this is a hoax call. All we ever get is hoax calls. So rat off, creep." There's a click, and the line goes dead.
It's your old friend Xam. "Hey," he says, "if you're coming over, could you bring the... hang on a minute..." You hear him calling "Who is it?", then he comes back on the line. "Get over here fast," he says. His voice is harsh with fear. "They're everywhere - all over the [house] - they must have..." There's a muffled scream, then another voice comes on the line. It says nothing; just laughs, very very quietly, before hanging up.
The postman walks into the garden from the orchard.
Poor old Lebling has appeared, standing in the doorway.
 He peers at you, breathing hard. "Yuss," he says, "well, see, this 'ere is for Mr Xam. You ain't Mr Xam. Plain to see. Can't give you the parcel. Yuss. Follow me meaning?" He turns the matter over in his "mind" for a while, then
The heat warms @ slightly.
Almost at melting point, @ becomes warped and mis-shaped. It looks like a totally different key.
The heat becomes too much for @ which melts, forming a shapeless blob.
A large cloud appears, performs a series of aerobatic manoeuvres before your eyes, and comes to a halt, looking pretty pleased with itself. You hear a voice in your [head] say "What ho! Jolly good show! Wizard, what?"
. A book lies on the floor
"Aquitania Postal Service - Notice of undelivered parcel. ^Our representative was unable to deliver a parcel addressed to you. Please dial 300 to arrange re-delivery ~Reference #045-776-86662-921-7/ZZXA55b"
You clamber inside the oven. Outside, you hear heavy footsteps. The familiar voice of the baker booms: "Where has that young bugger gone? Blimey; suppose I'll have to do it myself." The door slams shut and there is a click as the oven is switched on.
Some of the yucky bilge has already congealed into a lump of foul cheese, floating repellently on the surface.
You'd better put the canoe in the lagoon first.
You begin to dial, then realise there isn't a telephone here and hang up whatever it was you were dialling.
You'll have to dial a number.
But the oven door is closed.
You disconnect the spare tank.
Without warning, the lavatory lid starts flapping as a ghostly stench and raucous laughter fills the room. The washbasin belches blood as, with mounting horror, you see the claw foot of the bathtub reach out and slash at your leg. Muscles, veins and tendons spill from your ripped trousers, and just as you are beginning to think that this is all a bit over the top, the scene  fades, returning you and the room to normal.
Suddenly the bed begins to move, forcing you against the wardrobe, which swallows you and slams shut. You hammer on the door without avail; the tramp of seven tiny pairs of boots approaches and then the wardrobe is tilted on its side and carried away. A raucous chorus starts to sing: "Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go..."~You hear the sound of shovels on earth, but just as you are almost expiring with terror, the noise stops and everything returns to normal.
Shouldn't we be holding our little tool in our little hand first?
Excellent. Only 1277 more and you can make a papier-mache Ronald Reagan, indistinguishable from the real thing.
The fire goes out, leaving some ash. "'Ere!" shouts the publican, "I can do without that sort of thing!" "You'll have to, now!" you shout back wittily.
has burnt away to nothing.
The match flares into life.
It's now completely dark.
Typical summery garden sounds surround you.
Typical summery garden smells surround you.
The inspector glances at you suspiciously and says, "That was your stop. Tell you what, get off at the next one, and I'll say no more about it."
Suddenly you notice that a colossal, sweating, red-faced chef has emerged from the fridge, stropping a huge meat-cleaver on his leathery forearm. He stares at you greedily and begins to sing: "Tiptoe/Through the kitchen," he bellows, "With me meat-hook/And me red-hot cauldron...." and seizes you by the hair. You hardly have time to notice that he looks exactly like Oliver Hardy when you feel his chopper slice through your skull. The next thing you know, everything has returned to normal.
The magpie is rehearsing and resents your presence. Deciding to buy you off, he turns and rummages among his possessions. You catch glimpses of jewels and bright gold, but all you end up with is a pair of old spectacles.
Leave them alone or you will spoil them and then you'll be sorry.
^The match lights but a gust of wind extinguishes it.
A sudden surreptitious movement draws your attention to the bookshelves. Miraculously, your precious books have reappeared... but as you reach out to take one, it flies from the shelf with a high-pitched buzzing scream. One by one the books take to the air and circle around you, shrieking like angry bees. The sharp edges of the pages cut you about the face and hands as you wildly try to fend off the crazed, airborne, literary vortex. One book, more vicious than the rest, snaps wildly at your nose and severs it completely before flying off into the garden and burying itself in the earth. Just as you are recalling your mother's strangely prophetic words - "Nose buried in a book, as usual!"  things return to normal and your books are gone as though they had never been.
Something frightful is happening to the wicker chair: it is swelling and bulging like a frog in a blue blazer... heavy, bottle-bottom spectacles appear on its ghastly, mustachioed "face" as it looms above you, talking interminably in a penetrating, alliterative whine. Suddenly you realise you are in the grip not of a wicker chair, but a WHICKER chair -- yes, the dreaded TV personality Alan Whicker is here in your conservatory. As you watch in horror, the dreadful Whicker flickers, fades and shrinks down to a tiny white dot which, with a little "Plink!", turns into a wicker chair again.
It can only be opened from the outside.
Although the bus has long gone, you can hear the sound of distant whistling. The tuneless sound gets louder and louder and you notice to your horror that the wall has somehow softened, and is bellying out into the shape of a gigantic pair of pursed lips. The hooting, crooning whistling threatens to burst your eardrums as the huge, wallpapered face of the ticket inspector stares out at you with unearthly malice. Suddenly, without warning, the noise stops and the wall returns to normal.
lies woodenly on its side, like a fish out of [water]
The cloud shimmers slightly, and you hear a voice in your [head]. "Right," it says, "jolly good. Scramble! Good show! Gosh - hope I don't have a prang! Wizard!"
One sniff is enough to tell you that the flying mustard will dissolve your nostrils.
The wind soughs in the trees.
You bang your [head] on the [wall] repeatedly. (Magnetic Scrolls Ltd. makes no warranty, express or implied, that this activity will knock any sense into you whatsoever.)
Suddenly the air takes on a menacing violet tinge; the branches of the willow reach out and clasp you tightly to the tree's bole, while the gloves which were lying on the grass spring to life and grasp the secateurs. The gloves fly back and forth in front of your face, snipping and snapping menacingly. Just as you are feeling a bit of a prune, everything returns to normal.
The window looks in on a small back room. An oil lamp hangs above a tall metal stool.
You can hear a clearly intellectual magpie, singing Shostakovitch.
The boat smells sourly of very dead fish and oysters.
The wind whistles gently across the water.
 which is blocked by a large mound of dirt
The water goes "Splosh, splosh" and the little fishes outside go "Tootle tootle tum tum". (How long, O Lord, how long...?)
You are hampered in your efforts by something else you're wearing.
The match has already finished its work on earth, and has taken early retirement.
The passage is completely blocked by a mound of dirt.
It is no more possible than walking on water.
You're not suitably equipped for swimming. Besides, the water looks very cold.
^An enormous, bulging baker is standing here, munching steadily
The inspector is busy persecuting other passengers at the moment.^
Some means of propelling the canoe might help!
To go somewhere in the canoe, you must paddle it in a direction.
In [case] you hadn't noticed, there's an incredibly annoyed bull down there and we're not going to extend the definition of adventurous to include foolhardy.
Unfortunately, the bull is coming from that direction!^

hits the bull squarely on the head. He is suitably provoked.
The inspector moves along the bus in your direction.
"Tickets please," the inspector says with that particularly irritating brand of cheerfulness adopted by officials when exercising their authority.^
"Excuse me sir," says the inspector, tapping you on the shoulder, "but I need to see your ticket."
A note of intolerance edges the inspector's voice. "Look, show me your ticket, or I'll have to throw you off."
The inspector shouts something official at the driver and the bus screeches to a halt. The doors open and the inspector hurls you off.
The bus comes to a halt beside a [bus] stop and the [automatic doors](leave the bus) open.
But you're already in the house.^
The customers don't seem interested in intelligent discourse.
The wheel grinds round and you hear a click from the airlock door.^
The hearth is stone-cold and depressing.
"Don't try and crawl to me, you young whippersnapper! Never say no to a free beer though, cheers."
, 
You forgot to flush the airlock! The water in this room gushes away down the passage.^
You jump from your perilous perch to the safety of the platform.
"Har har har," laughs the guardian, "I'm immortal."
You land with one foot on the girder and promptly lose your balance. Gravity is now playing a major role in your life.
The dragon emits a colossal blast of searing flame, burning you to a crisp.~*** You have died ***~Actually, nothing of the sort happens, but that's the sort of dragon game you like to play in the bath.
Donk.
The hatch won't open, no matter how hard you try.
The chamber floods with very wet water.
The water is slowly forced out of the chamber by compressed air.
Oh! no- You'll flood the whole place! The airlock starts to fill with water.
You feel as if your lungs are bursting...
A feeling of euphoria comes over you as someone else's life flashes before your eyes.
**You appear to be drowning.**^
Vile unearthly laughter echoes around you.
The water has reached 
your ankles.
your knobbly knees.
your scraggy thighs.
your beer belly.
your pigeon chest.
your scrawny neck.
The water is way past your nasal passage.
Is it an unearthly gust of wind from beyond the tomb, or merely some passer-by walking over your grave that makes your hair stand on end...?
Absolutely nothing happens.
Absolutely nothing happens.

The door appears to be dreadfully stuck...
With a gentle sigh, the aqualung gives up the ghost.

**You won't last long without an air supply!**^
BANG! A door slams in the empty house...
As you peer beneath @ it starts collapsing on top of you. You withdraw your head in time to avert disaster... but oddly enough @ feels quite stable now.
The fridge hums a happy refrigerator refrain.
You thrash about wildly but get nowhere
No, no, no. Silly. You sit down again, just in time.
The guard peers out of the window and stares at you gloomily. "Right," he mutters, dragging you inside and locking you in the guard's van. "Tap dancing. Dog's life. Dear oh dear..." he whimpers, and potters away.
O how horrid and nasty. Ugh!
You remember that that's the number for Directory Enquiries, who are never, ever there as part of the new Customer Service policy; so you put the telephone down again.
"'Allo, beeg boy!" says a seductive voice. Morally outraged, you hang up at once.
"Directory Enquiries," says a voice, "how did you find our direct line?" You are so shocked that you hang up in amazement.
You hear the characteristic sound of a bull masticating a cornflower.
There's an almighty \_creeeaaaaak_\, but 
Moving easily and silently in its runners, 
There's a loud **bang** and a whiff of cordite as the crazed gardener rushes past you cackling wildly, a bag flung over his shoulder, and heads off into the distance. Panic-stricken he even loses a lot of his stuff without noticing.
The crazed gardener is sitting on the waterfront, oiling a large machine gun. Only when you are right behind him does he notice you; then, with a cry of "Capability Ruddy Brown!" he runs off into the distance, leaving a small bag behind in his confusion.

Summoned by the bell, the postmistress materialises silently from heaven knows where and stands in position behind the counter.^
He easily avoids @ with an official manoeuvre (No. 188382/a/22 - "avoiding @ thrown by passengers.")
The inspector calls after you, saying: "Oi! You forgot these!" He tosses a bunch of keys to you. Hopelessly uncoordinated, you fail to catch them.^
You are powerless against the gushing water.
^The sounds of less enthusiastic whistling come from outside the front door.
The train pops out into the light like a cork from a bottle
A damn fool thing to do, trying to stand up in a tunnel.
It would help if you removed the match box from @ first!
He grimaces horribly at you, in what is intended to be a welcoming smile. "Good afternoon," he sprays through a mouthful of lemon curd; "how may I help you?"
Up ahead, the track snakes around the mountainside in a vicious hairpin bend.
Is there, or isn't there, such a thing as centrifugal force? As the train careers wildly around the bend, you will soon find out.
Yes... there IS such a thing as centrifugal force, and it has thrown you off the train.
The train finally grinds to a halt and the guard says, "\_Mountain Top_!\. All change please, exit on the [left](west)."^
The oven goes quietly about its business. After a while, a gentle "chuff" suggests that the process is complete.

The door closes, ringing the bell.

"Oh, it's not the train I mind. It's every Tom, Dick and Harry who thinks he can travel on it just because he's got a [ticket], they're the ones that annoy me..."
The coin falls into place with a click.
"That lot? The girls are the worst, come on here dressed like... well, I say dressed but really it's indecent, and none of them ever give me a second glance, just because I'm ugly." He snuffles for a moment in self-pity.
Drums crash and rattle and steam bursts from the pipes as the organ starts to play. The carousel turns, the animals rising and falling. You begin to feel dizzy...
The calliope is playing "Corporal Popper's Lonely Lungs Society Orchestra," a Sixties number which never quite made the charts.
"Oh, all for it, in its proper place. Drives that crusty old sod of a station-master mad, though - hee hee hee!"
"That old bugger? No time for him, no time at all, just a big intolerant bully, and don't think I don't know the things he says about me behind my back, because I do, so there." He sniffs haughtily and turns away.

With a satisfying little sequence of mousetrap noises, the mousetrap sets itself. It is now ready to catch a mouse.
The mousetrap makes a series of mousetrap-setting noises, then a little disappointed creak. Perhaps you should think again about mousetrap-setting.
 The mousetrap is set and poised, as it were, to spring.
 Not being set, this mousetrap offers no threat to mice.
No. No. No. I am NOT going anywhere near that mousetrap.
Two indistinct voices can be heard.
The voices sound pessimistic as regards your chances of survival.
The machine is ominously silent at the moment.
The place reeks of antiseptic.
You jump off the bridge onto the train roof below.
^Oh-oh, that was presumably an impolicy. \_Somehow, you don't feel quite as lucky as you did_\.^
The train has arrived at its destination, and the Guard releases you from captivity.
A wise move, but a tricky one. Alive to the danger of your situation, you twizzle your legs perilously through the window, retaining an insecure grasp on the roof. Then, just as it seems certain that you will fall beneath the wheels, you execute a deft twist and half-leap, and shoot in through the window. Well done.
"Right," mutters the stationmaster to himself, "might as well close up for the day, put me feet up, have a cuppa. Fair enough? Fair enough." Without further ado, he slams the hatch shut.
What sort of idiot puts a holed canoe in the water? You?
"Oh, yurss," says the guardian, "oh defnly. Right. 'Narmean? Dunno, as it were."
"Werl," says the guardian, "it's... they're... we've... er..." His voice tails off pathetically and he stands picking his nose for a moment in gloom.
"Werl," he mumbles, obviously playing for time, "I was down the old frog-and-toad having an apples-and-pairs and I sez to the old Hampton Wick, I sez, 'Give us a bottle-and-glass in the old hot dinner and I'll Aristotle any tit-fer-tat in the boat-race'"... He realises he is being rather unconvincing. "Dunno," he adds despondently, "'Narmean?"
"I'm with you there, Squire," he murmurs.
It's a bit bunged up already.
\_"Out!"_\ shrieks the guard, pushing you off the train; \_"Out out out!"_\
The stationmaster says, "Sorry, we only accept Fergs."
The unicorn springs to life, shaking the saddle free. 
High above, you can see the unicorn hovering.
Alas, you are thrown off @ in the process. 
The unicorn, becoming tired, sees the lush grass here on the mountain top and slowly descends nearby to begin grazing.

The unicorn bucks, throwing you off, onto the ground.
The moment the saddle touches the creature's back, he freezes and stands quite still; he is turning slowly back into wood.
Once again, the unicorn trembles and shudders as life flows through his body.
Been reading "101 Uses For A Dead Wossname," then? I hope you have the courage of your convictions.

"How vile," sneers the inspector. "It'll make your teeth crooked, too, you know." 
After studying the ticket briefly, he says, "Neverending Lane eh? That's only two stops from here. [Enjoy](wait) the countryside!" Returning your ticket, he begins to whistle.
The inspector simply won't stop whistling tunelessly. You wonder what on earth he is so happy about.
"It's okay sonny, I only need to see it once." he says.
He turns to you grumpily. "Hang on," he says, "What's the hurry? One at a time." He hands a ticket back to one of the other passengers.
Okay, so you got to the end. There's ALWAYS one isn't there. What do you do for an encore? Eh? Walk all the way back, that's what, har har har!

Down you go, with all the aerodynamic elegance of a slab of beef. You land with a thud - a dull one, to be precise.
You float to the ground, just like Mary Poppins.
The Guard rushes up to you, his face purple with rage. "No busking on the train!" he shouts, "No busking on the train! Stop it at once, or I'll scream!"
"Right! That's it," says the guard as he grabs you. "It's the guard's van for you..."
As you enter the conservatory, the telephone in the library begins to ring.
Your telephone is ringing.
The ringing stops.
You get a dialling tone.
As you bend to pick up the keyring, a sudden tremendous roaring fills your ears, like the roar of the sea. It is not, however, the roar of the sea, but the roar of an inhumanly, abominably, unfairly colossal bus. Your response to this hideous threat to your existence is to stand immobile with your mouth hanging open.^
The document is knee-deep in coffee stains, doodles and unfinished games of Hangman. Beneath the caffeine and ink, however, the plight of Aquitania is outlined in a superb example of bureaucratic gobbledygook, the essence of which is as follows:^\_The legendary Turani Bracelet, the source of Aquitania's good fortune and that which undermines the power of the evil coven of Green Witches, has become separated from its five charms. In this disassembled form its power is no longer a match for the witches. Jannedor, the [head] of the coven, was instrumental in the demise of Aquitania's luck and now hopes to seize control before the bracelet can be reunited with its charms. The Guardians, who have been administering the luck since the untimely demise of Turani, have due to a lack of administrative resources decided to co-opt a member of the general public as Special Consultant to the Investigative Sub-Committee of the Inter-Departmental Steering Committee of the Working Group of the Standing Committee on Administrative Administration and Internal Affairs_\.^In short: You've got the job of finding the five charms, re-uniting them with the bracelet and zapping Jannedor into oblivion.~Gloomily, the guardian watches you read. When you have finished, he swallows his last bit of sandwich.~"Horrible stuff," he says, grimacing, "processed. What's the point in being immortal and godlike if you can't get a decent bit of cheese. Or," he adds, almost as an afterthought, "if you can't sort out wossnames. Witches. Eh? Anyway, that's your job. Reassemble the bracelet of Turani, turn its amazing occult wossname, force, on Jannedor, save civilisation as we know it. Piece of cake. Should be finished by teatime. Off you go. I'll try and keep an eye on you - might even answer a few questions if you're lucky - but you'll have to take pot wossname, 'narmean? Luck." ~He begins to shimmer and fade. "Lucky for some, innit?" he mutters as his image grows fainter, "Gawd knows when I'll get my supper..."~...and with that final, heartrending cry ringing in your ears, the figure is gorn.^
says, "Do me a favour. Read the er, wossname or I'll never get home in time for supper."^
Ding!^
The other passengers look at you with some annoyance; they obviously aren't getting off at the next stop.
The driver turns and glares at you as if to say: "These ears work you know".
The bus screeches to a halt and the driver stalks down the aisle towards you, the word HATE written across his face. "I don't have to drive this bloody bus, you know," he hisses. "I'm a qualified brain surgeon." He looks at you meaningfully, then  returns to his seat, muttering curses under his breath, and resumes the journey.
There's a strange smell here. It's one of those smells that you can't quite place - and perhaps you never will.
The driver turns to point to the sign behind him, and, in doing so, almost swerves off the road.
The passengers look the other way and ignore your attempts at conversation.
Ah! That was a relief!
You try but give up as you don't need to go yet.
The lavatory flushes noisily.
What jolly fun this is! And now we're on the floor with a bruised fundament! Hooray!

The roses smell like onions, a problem you have yet to resolve.
The baker smells the bread, prods it with a huge dirty thumb, breaks off a piece and licks it, then stuffs the whole thing into his mouth. You can hear (and, alas, see) the entire process; it's a bit like watching an out-of-control cement mixer.
The baker takes a healthy bite out of the loaf, and you can hear the sound of teeth smashing. In disgust, he hurls the loaf of bread at you, which  flies through the door, bouncing across the village green. He stares at you with loathing. "The sign," he snarls, "said 'Smart Lad Wanted'. If I'd wanted a moron, I'd have said 'Moron Wanted.' Get out of here! Go on!"^Grasping you by the collar, he throws you out into the village green.
The baker recognises you. "Don't call us," he smirks, "we'll call you."
The baker gives a howl of incoherent rage and throws you out.
An overpowering aroma of freshly-baked bread assails your nostrils.
The [landlord](do publican) pulls you a pint with about as much pleasure as if he were drawing his own blood (which, judging by his appearance, would be more alcoholic than the beer).

twitches violently for a while, before becoming still once more.
 He takes to the air, rising slowly up into the sky above.
Nothing obvious happens.
The window looks in on a small workshop. Inside, the room is engulfed in flame.
^No time for that now. There is a squeal of brakes, followed by a sickening dull cliche as a small dog (which was innocently munching on a passing  microscopic space fleet) is propelled into the Land Where Doggies Are Eternally Blessed by a large bus. You, on the other [hand], are propelled to the kerbside by a firm grip on your collar, and, when you recover your so-called "senses", you see a large, pot-bellied figure in a herringbone [overcoat] hovering a couple of feet above the pavement munching a cheese [sandwich].~"It's a dog's life," says the figure, a little tactlessly in the circumstances, "Sacred Coconut of this, Holy Banana of that, Magic Axolotl of the other. Dunno why I bother, really. Never see the wife and kids." He pauses reflectively and brushes a few crumbs of processed cheddar from his moustache. "Mind you," he continues, "can't stand the sight of the wife and kiddies, so I suppose it's not too bad."~He looks at you with mournful vigilance. "I am one of the Guardians. I am currently attached to the Department of Turani, Sacred Charm subdivision. Wouldn't believe I was immortal, would you? You wouldn't look at me and say 'Stone me, a bleeding immortal being, God-like in his majesty?' Werl... there you are, then. Which is why we need a mortal. Heard of Jannedor? Jannedor the wossname? Witch? Causing a bit of aggravation, spot of bother, 'narmean? I have here an official document as will clarify the ongoing position at this point in time."~He hands you a document.^

The guardian 
fiddles irritably with a loose herringbone on his overcoat.
. Almost hidden among the tattered and fish-gnawed [ruins](do debris), you spy for a second something gleaming and metallic in the half-light.

Unfortunately, you just cannot separate the oil from the water. Maybe you can think of a cold-hearted approach.
says "It ain't free you know!"
^"Oh, good show!" the voice murmurs in your [head]; "If only I were feeling a touch more... \_animated_\, we could pop orf for a spin, eh?"
^There's an ominous creak, followed by a really, really ominous creak, and a snap, and a whoosh, and a crash, and a little squeal. The little squeal is yours, as you realise the fan has crashed to the ground, missing your head by inches.
The glint and sparkle of a coin being thrown into the well attracts you. Before you can catch it, it disappears below you with a distant plop.
There is a loud crash as one of the other customers plummets into the well, using you to cushion his fall. "Shorry", he saysh, as he climbs out again.
Merciful heavens! A dreaded rat is here! Oh no it isn't! It's gone again! Well, well, well!
You are rudely disturbed as someone decides to take the opportunity to relieve himself down the well. Mind you, it could have been worse.
. There are two Gothic [doors](look doors) set into the far wall. You begin to realise that the architect of this place had something of a one-track mind
The fat baker waddles [downstairs](go down), shouting "Get on! Get on! Haven't got all day!"
He spots the debris from the flour sack. "Hey! What have you been [up] to?" He  starts searching you, and all your belongings. 
He waves @ under your nose. "Trying to sneak off with this, eh? Nasty little thief! Get out!" He drags you to the door and throws you out.
After a while, he gives [up], obviously disappointed.

^You're totally ratted.
^You are completely smashed.
^Your brain cells are dying faster than lemmings off a cliff.

It seems very difficult all of a sudden!

There's nowhere to go but down, and you're doing that already!
The guardian cruises [up] alongside you.^
"Problems, chief?" he enquires nonchalantly.
"Ah, sorted it out eh?" he says, swimming off into the distance, "Saves me the bother I s'pose." 
The light's not so good here. Let's go [upstairs](go up), and show it to me there.
Gloomy old sod. We've always had gloomy old sods in this pub. It's a sort of gloomy old tradition.
Erm... it's a sort of building, and you give the man money and he gives you beer. That's roughly how it works.
A bit cloudy, but then for one Ferg a pint what do you expect? Thunder and ruddy lightning?
Charm? Charm? What do you mean, charm? You one of them ruddy woofters, then? We don't go much on charm round here.
The key doesn't \_quite_\ fit.
^The bread disintegrates into charred crumbs.
The trapdoor is closed!
 @ falls out!
He peers curiously at you. "Nice shade of blue that, your face," he says, with an astonishing lack of humanity.
After a while, a bunch of tourists stroll by;
 they stop to watch you for a while.
The tourists peer about, looking for somewhere to make a donation,
 they gaze at you, obviously deeply disappointed in your performance.
Presently, the tourists walk away.
You are obviously even worse than the tourists thought; far from making a donation, they reach into the hat and steal your coin.
For a moment, it looks as though the tourists are going to make a donation; but then they look into your hat. Whatever they see there makes them change their minds.
Your expertise as an entertainer bears fruit; smirking smugly, one of the tourists drops a silver coin into your hat.
You'll need to be a bit more entertaining than that if you want to busk here.
"Aqualungs," he says, with just a hint of sarcasm. "Useful devices you know. You ought to try it sometime." Strapping the aqualung to your back, he heads off into the distance with a well-practised breast stroke. 
^The ground is getting closer.
A familiar figure, suspended below the canopy of a parachute, swings into view. "Long way down, innit?" he remarks, helpfully.
With the smug expression of a fig-leaf salesman who has just stumbled across an apple core in the Garden of Eden, the guardian casually enquires: "Interest you in a parachute?"
Strapping a parachute to your back, he says, "Naw, only kidding. Lucky I carry a spare eh?" With the harness secure, he pulls the ripcord and the canopy unfolds, filling with air. Unfortunately, your stomach, being unaware of the finer points of sky-diving, continues at its previous rate of descent. A few moments later, much to your relief, you touch down on terra firma and the parachute winks out of existence.
No.^
The straps restrain you.
Afraid you'll have to tapdance there, Mr. Astaire.
Sorry, but the hatch is closed.
Your brain rapidly fills up with misleading nonsense, and after learning more about the Aardvark than you wished to know, you replace the book before you fall asleep.
Look, it's a twenty five foot drop. Surely, things can't be that bad? Just think, you have your whole life before you: new and exciting things to do; strange and exotic places to visit; people to meet; hearts to break. There's a whole world out there, just waiting to be grabbed by the throat and milked for all it's worth by Mr. Right. What? You're not Mr. Right? Oh, sorry. Forget everything I just said. What the hell, jump. See if I care.
Better to wait until you visit the dentist.
Something, somewhere, collapses noisily. Perhaps you aren't quite as alone in the house as you thought...
A wee timourous sleekit mousie pops into the kitchen to root among the mess. Seeing your ugly mug, he wisely pops out again. \_Pop!_\
Without the proper footwear, you'd be doing a soft-shoe shuffle, which went out of fashion years ago.^
Your tap-dancing is terrible, but fortunately nobody notices.
Perhaps you ain't got rhythm but your shoes certainly do; 
 tap-dancing wildly they jump about and dance a snappy number in front of you for a while before moving off by themselves into the distance.
your feet are dancing and you cannot stop.
Hell, you dancin' fit to bust already - cain't stop nohow, neither!
You raise the harmonica to your lips and begin to play, astounding yourself with your unexpected virtuosity.
. Nearby hangs a rope which appears to be attached to a wooden hatch
The rope isn't long enough to reach the door.
. There's a rather nice fly bath here; you and Xam spend many a happy summer evening watching the little flies disport themselves with merry cries and fluttering of wings. In the winter, of course, they all go up Dead Fly Wood and snuff it
Which spell?
You cannot move freely enough here to cast such a spell.
The doofer spell wears off and the shoes stop dancing leaving you weary with exhaustion.
Your busking eventually bears fruit. Just as your lips are beginning to wear out and your feet to fray, you hear a hoarse cry of rage from the stationmaster's office. "All right, all right," he bellows, "You win. I'll sell you a ticket half-price. Anything to get rid of you."
The stationmaster peers gloomily at your proffered Ferg. For a moment, it looks as if he will have to sell you a ticket, but then his little eyes light up. "Ah!" he cries "I jes remembered, tickets is 2 Fergs on account of where today's date times the telephone number of the engine-driver's cousin is less than my missus's birthday to base 13. It's in the rules, see." He smirks abominably at you, gratified to have thwarted yet another paying customer.
You have completely ruined the stationmaster's day. In deep depression, he jabs at the gadget in front of him, tears off a ticket and hands it to you in silence.
A gust of wind catches you unawares and flicks the [ticket] out of your hand. The [ticket] sails gracefully eastwards towards the platform.
The wind dies down long enough for you almost to grasp the [ticket], then, almost wilfully, gusts again and whisks the [ticket] further along the platform.
It's touch and go now: you are touching the ticket, and the train is ready to go. You grab the ticket just as the [train], with a piercing whistle, moves off. The locomotive is bearing down on you and gathering speed rapidly; you \_just_\ manage to scramble away as the hot breath of the engine blasts against you. Panting with effort and trembling with fear, you watch the train recede into the distance. Although it is still moving relatively slowly, it's unlikely that you could run fast enough to catch up with it.
The carriage door is back along the platform.
A group of tourists wanders past.

She looks surprised: "You don't need to pay me for anything!"
Unfortunately @ moves up.
Strangely, @ clicks down.
^There is a barely audible click from deep in the safe.
"Not so fast, buster, not so fast," she snarls, "pay your bill before I takes any more orders."
The postmistress takes @ , and slaps it down on the scales. 
The baker suddenly rummages through @ , and comes up clutching the charm.
You cannot remove the shoes whilst you are dancing!
Why the rush? The train is still here (though for how much longer, there's no way to tell).
Heart pounding and lungs bursting, you charge up the tracks after the rapidly-accelerating train.
With a final burst of speed, you leap forward and claw wildly for a handhold on the train. For a terrible moment, you seem certain to fall, but the guard - who has been waiting at the back of the train - extends a hand and hauls you aboard. 
^"All aboard!" shrieks the guard, and with a screech of whistles, a slamming of doors, and much huffing and puffing, the train begins to pull out of the station.
Alas! Not to mention alack! The train has gone without you.
^After a while, the guard approaches to inspect the tickets.
"Right," flounces the guard, "Let's be seeing your [ticket], then."
"Look," he says, "let's not have a scene. Show me the [ticket]."
"Listen, flowerpot," says the guard, "if you don't have a [ticket] I shall really have to throw you off. Just like that. Poof!" He stands there, arms akimbo, looking petulant, gloomy and malignant, all at once.
"Right," snarls the guard, "that's it. I've had enough. You're not getting away with it. Just because I'm not good-looking, you people think you can take me for a ride." He bursts into tears, and his misery seems to increase his strength; he drags you off to the guard's van and locks you in.
The guard takes your ticket and scrutinises it carefully, hoping to find some technical invalidity. He then hands it back to you. "Thank you," he says, deprived of the opportunity to exert his authority, "Thank you so very bloody much."
"What's this supposed to be," says the guard pointing to 
"Bang-on, buster. You're a pleasure to do business with."
As the postmistress surfaces from under the counter with @ in her hands, poor bloody Lebling sticks his [head] round the door. She gives @ to him, with directions as to where to take it, and he scurries away.
"Already seen it," says the guard gloomily, "thank you very much, I don't think."
"This some kind of a joke, wise-guy? There's no such address. Here - take @ back and address it properly."
"Excuse me," he says, taking the sack away from you, "You won't be needing that to bake the bread."
"That," she sneers, tossing @ back to you contemptuously, "ain't getting you nowhere."
The postmistress bursts into tears. "Nobody never gave me a tip before," she blubs happily.
Ferg@ dead, kid." She takes @ and places it behind the counter.
A pained voice from the scales says "Oof! Sheer blubber!"^
The scales boom "
 tharg@ precisely!", causing you to remove @ in a hurry!^ 
Jannedor enters the room and totters towards the fireplace. So obsessed is she that she doesn't notice a loud crash from the kitchen. Noticing the ashes, she pokes her skinny greenish claw up the chimney and starts groping about for her crystal ball.
She shouts "Lebling! Get your damn butt in here!" She bends down and fumbles around behind the counter for a while, looking for something...
"Hands off, dude, or Lebling'll blow you away!" snarls the postmistress.
You are already face down on the top of the train.
You lie flat, face down on the top of the train.
As the train winds it's way ever upward, **a tunnel in the distance catches your eye**.
I don't wish to alarm you, but **the tunnel is very low**, and almost as close.
You will now have to come to terms with the fact that you are on the roof of a train which is just about to enter, at high speed, **a tunnel with a very low arch**.
A wall of wind hits you as the train rushes into the tunnel, which offers minimal clearance. You lie as low as you can flat on the roof of the train, gripping onto whatever you can.
The Guard says, "If you haven't got a proper [ticket] you'd better get off." With a grin of satisfied malevolence, he pushes you off the train onto the platform.
You daren't!
You get up, daringly.
Expecting to wake up and find yourself dead, you are a little perplexed when a tentative attempt at opening your eyes reveals a small, brightly lit room. The surroundings are strange and unfamiliar, sounds of muffled [voices](listen to voices) reach your ears, and your limbs feel constricted and remote. The only thing of which you feel at all sure of at this point is that you are naked and strapped to a cold hard surface.
Gradually, the room stops spinning and the [voices](listen to voices) become a little more distinct. Unable to move, you decide to lie still and listen for a while.
\_["Swab,"]_\ says a male voice. "Swab," replies a female voice.
\_["Scalpel,"]_\ says the male voice. "Scalpel," replies the female. A shadow looms over you and you catch a glint of light on naked steel as the instrument is lowered towards your body.
\_"Anaesthetic,"_\ says the male voice. The nurse covers your face with a mask; the room resumes its spinning antics and you feel somewhat dizzy.
\_"Wossname,"_\ says the male voice. "Wossname," replies the female. There is a loud clunk followed by a mechanical whirring sound. You brace yourself as the device is lowered towards your cranium. Luckily, the anaesthesia overcomes you at this point, rendering you unconscious once more.
\_bleep_\  
\_bleeeeep_\ 
\_bing bleeeeeeeeeep_\ 
Your optimism is highly commendable. It is, however, no match for a solid concrete tunnel. **Slamming into the tunnel, you pass out**.^
^A tiny charm is left in the sieve!^
You sift through the flour carefully.
You wonder about the difficulties posed by heavier-than-air flight.
You were quite right about the difficulties of heavier-than-air-flight. Under your present circumstances, they are insurmountable. You therefore fail to surmount them, hit the ground, and pass out.^
^After an indeterminate passage of time, you regain consciousness.~
^The machine next to the operating table goes 
The ground trembles in sympathy as the hooves of the advancing beast power into its sodden surface. Suddenly, the earth beneath the bull gives way, leaving it with no alternative but to drop into the newly formed hole.^
The gaoler here wakes up and sees you, 
"Not you again", says the gaoler gruffly, "How the hell did you escape". He then grabs forces you back into your cell, slamming the door after.
Think what a phenomenal mess you would make!^
There's an almighty crash, a confused 'moo' and a hoarse cry of alarm, then a [head] pokes out of the hole, clad in a miner's helmet. "Don't give me all that [bull]," says a voice from beneath the helmet, then laughs hilariously and disappears underground.
"You're not getting anything more out of me," he snarls. "Just use your loaf, laddie."
Pretty hot stuff, eh?

Just a doughboy. Says he works hard, but his job's a piece of cake. I hear his wife's got a bun in the oven...

tall enough, the candle overbalances it and falls out.
The candle is now directly underneath the rope.
The candle flame soon burns through the tattered rope.
The hatch slides down with a crash.
the inner hatch slides down; simultaneously, the outer [shutter](go north) opens, and you are free. Relatively, that is.
Interesting... as you pull on the rope, the shutter rises to reveal one of those little "dumb waiters". That is to say, a little space with another shutter on the far side. It looks as though the outer shutter closed by means of some interlocking mechanism as the inner shutter opened, probably so that the unfortunate prisoner could get at his food without ever being able to glimpse the outside world.~After a few moments, the weight of the shutter becomes too much for you; you let go of the rope, and the hatch crashes shut.
You raise the shutter with the rope, which is now long enough to reach the manacles. Once tied, the taut rope keeps the hatch shutter open.
You put @ underneath the rope.
Unfortunately, it falls over.
There's no space, the rope hangs to the ground.
You decide to slide block

Ouch! You prick your fingers on one of the glass fragments in the attempt.
Carefully you pick up the bracelet and shake off the glass fragments.

Xam makes a mad dash for the door, shouting "I'm free, I'm free!" His shouts stir the sleeping gaoler. "How did you get out?" bawls the gaoler, catching hold of Xam. He summons a guard and tells him to take Xam to Jannedor. Turning to you, the gaoler blows you a raspberry and slams the cell door shut.
Unfortunately, the door can only be opened and closed from the gaoler's side.
The worms utter little cries of wormy delight and burrow into the pile of dirt. After a few moments of frantic activity, the dirt mound looks much looser.
You clear the loose dirt away with little effort, revealing a passage to the east.
It's too tightly packed for you to make an impression.
Released from confinement, the worms wriggle away.^
On balance, they're a good thing.
We are only here to serve your delivery requirements. You say 'post this to there' and we oblige. That was a paid announcement. Now tell me what you want before I set the cat on you, buster.
The postmistress fixes her gaze with yours. "Hey, toots!" she bawls. "Yeah, you with the nose. What's your game eh? Cattle rustling? Well, this sure ain't the prairie mister - this is a Post Office. Here we do things my way. What I say goes, gettit? And what I say is this: post something somewhere, or get out. Them's the rules, bud."
Poor bloody Lebling. Over the hill. Reckon we're going to have to shoot him, before long.
"What ho!" says the cloud; "Here we are, then! Wizard! Good egg!"
The dragon shudders as life courses through its veins, attempts to incinerate you in a searing blast of flame, fails (being new at the arson game), and [flies] off in a fit of pique.
The pelican flutters its feathers as life courses through its veins, attempts to eat the entire carousel, fails, and [flies] off looking for something to store in its beak.
The fire engine shudders as life courses through its engine. Before your very eyes it grows to be life-sized and attempts to extinguish you. It fails, however, and roars off noisily to look for a hydrant, leaving behind a ladder.
The walruses waggle their moustaches as life courses through their veins, eat the state carriage, belch happily at each other, and waddle off into the distance.
Honestly, I've had about as much of this as I can take. No. Do you understand me? NO.

Xam wakes, bleary as usual. Then he realises it's you. "Free at last!" he yells, "Free! Free! Free!" Inevitably, the noise wakes the gaoler, who peers into the cell. 
"Oi!" he yells, "You! Right!" He summons a guard who drags Xam off to Jannedor, then turns to you. "Oi!" he yells, "You! Right!" He hurls you against the dungeon wall, blows a violent raspberry at you, and slams the door.
The unicorn is high up in the sky, way beyond your reach.

The guardian enters from the hallway and regards the phone with some distaste. "Sorry about this," he says. "It's probably the wife. Always pestering me at work. Can't get a moments peace, 'narmean?" He answers the phone.^"Look," he says to the caller, "how many times have I told you not to call me at work? What?... Who?... Oh? Hang on." He hands the receiver to you. "It's for you," he says, "chap by the name of Xam." Leaving you holding the phone, he departs.^

keeps saying things like 'Yus' and 'really wossname'
The guardian ambles up beside you. "Nice here innit?" he says. "Yus, really wossname. Nice."
The guardian turns to leave. "Too bloody nice for my liking," he complains, strolling off into the distance. "Next thing you know, I'll have to bring the wife and wossnames, kiddies, here for a picnic. Not bloody likely, I'm off."
"Canoes," he says thoughtfully, "don't work with holes in 'em, 'narmean? Now if you was to bung the hole up with sunnink big enough, it might help some."
standing beside you, conducting an imaginary orchestra
A rustle from behind alerts you to the presence of the guardian. He enters on all fours and stands, ear cocked in appreciation, beside you.
The magpie pauses for breath during the most intricate passage of the piece, whereupon the guardian breaks into spontaneous applause. "Amazin," he says. "If only there were more people with the classical wossname, education to appreciate such works." He departs the bush, as the magpie, obviously annoyed by the interruption, resumes the song.
He puts a finger to his lips and whispers, "Shhhhh, I'm trying to listen, and it wouldn't do you any harm to do the same, 'narmean?"
fiddling with the mailbox
The guardian strolls into the garden and begins to fiddle with the mailbox.
With a swift kick directed at the mailbox, the guardian shrugs his shoulders and departs.
"Nasty cheap plastic things," he says. "I had one once. Trouble was, we had this heatwave see, and the bleedin' key melted. Wouldn't fit the lock after that, 'narmean?"
staring at the door
The guardian sidles into the boathouse and taps you on the shoulder. "'Narmean?" he says nodding towards the door.
The guardian wanders off.
"Badly maintained, innit?" he says. "A spot of lubrication would work wonders, 'narmean?"
prodding the dirt
A shadow falls across the floor. Turning, you see that the guardian is standing behind you. "Don't mind me," he says brushing some loose herringbones from his overcoat. "Thought I'd just drop in, see how you were doing, 'narmean?"
"Well, I'll be off then," says the guardian making his way back up the steps.
"Packed solid innit?" he says prodding it with a finger, "Even a worm would have trouble getting through that, I dare say."
listening to his watch
The guardian wanders into the room and points an accusing finger over his shoulder towards the clockmaker's shop. "Bleedin' rip-off merchant," he rages as he straps his watch to his wrist. "'No discounts for immortals'," he says, ridiculing the clockmaker's voice. "I ask you, what does an honest working being have to do around here? Eh?"
"Look," says the guardian listening to his watch. "Look, it's stopped! What's this place coming to? Eh? Eh? A simple repair job, that's all it was. And what happens? Five minutes later it stops. Stops! I'm gonna sort that geezer out once and for all." With that he ambles off towards the village green in search of the clockmaker.
"Long way up, innit?" he says. "Dare say you'd need a ladder to get up there, 'narmean?"
staring at the view. "Cor," he mutters from time to time, "'narmean?"
You hear a brief but friendly grunt and turn to see the guardian standing beside you. "Nice day for it," he says, peering at the view. "You could see Sumatra from here," he adds, "if we was anywhere near Sumatra. Which we aren't, of course." He sucks his teeth meditatively.
"Werl," says the Guardian, "can't stand around here all day. Got to buy some sardines. The kids is buggers for sardines." With a rustle of herringbone, he is gone.
"Ah," says the Guardian, "werl... it's all a question of weather you want to go out on a limb, if you follow my meaning." He looks thoughtfully at the sky. "Bloody charming," he mutters. "Could be in for a spell of rain..."
is dangling precariously beside you
Without warning the beam pivots, and you are carried back inside the clock tower. Inexplicably, the guardian is lurking inside the tower; he jumps aboard and the two of you are swung back outside as the mechanism comes full circle.
"Werl, must be off," says the guardian relaxing his grip on the figurine. He drops towards the village green below, flapping his arms furiously. A second or two pass before a distant, and slightly Doppler-shifted voice, reaches your ears: "Do me a favour?" it pleads, "In future, remind me not to jump off tall buildings on Fridays will you? Bleedin' parachute's at the laundry, innit?"
"Read that thing by Fred Hoyle," he says, "'The Black Wossname, Cloud'. All about a cloud which was alive. Mind you, don't see how that would get you anywhere..."
pottering about aimlessly, waiting for fun and jollity to come his way
The guardian wanders in, looking for a good time.
Having failed to find a good time, the guardian disconsolately wanders off again.
The guardian fixes his gaze on the fire. "Marvellous invention," he muses, "bloody marvellous. Where would we be without it? Eh? Frozen, that's where. Probably still be huddled in a cave somewhere, 'narmean? Anyway, it's not all good news; think of all the ash and wossname. Nasty business. Mind you, ash does have it's uses too, 'narmean?"
is trying to look inconspicuous
A tourist in a herringbone overcoat sidles up alongside you. "Pssst!" he hisses, prodding you with a finger, "Pssst! It's me! Like the wossname, disguise?" he says, pointing at his Japanese camera. 
The 'tourist' wanders away, pausing periodically to photograph several really interesting bits of the platform.
"There's one sure-fire way to get a ticket out of that old buffer," he says, pointing towards the stationmaster's hatch. "Did you see the wossname, sign, he put up about busking? Eh? Werl, he HATES buskers. Can't stand 'em, 'narmean? Catch my drift? Follow my meaning? Nudge nudge, say no more? Eh?"
shouting instructions to his Sherpas
"This way lads," comes a voice from behind. You turn to see the guardian leading a team of Sherpas towards the edge of the precipice. "Right, over you go," he says directing them in a generally downward direction. "[Head] for the castle, I'll be right with you. Just catch me breath for a moment."^He pauses beside you, breathing heavily.
"Wish me luck," the guardian says, swinging himself over the precipice. With that, he is gone.
"Werl," he says, "it just so happens that we're off to the castle ourselves. I'd take you along, but there'll probably be a lot of floating around and general 'guardian-type' stuff like that along the way. You'd never make it. Anyway, enough of this horsing around, I've got to saddle up and be on my way, 'narmean?"
mumbling about sub-standard accommodation and swindling travel agents
Out of nowhere, the guardian appears. "Strewth," he says, grimacing at the surroundings. "Last time I go on a package holiday. 'Four star accommodation' it said in the brochure. Wait till I get my hands on that travel agent." He begins to inspect the room.
"Werl, I'm off," mutters the guardian. "And, if I were you, I'd do the same. Oh, I forgot, you can't can you? Har har har." He leaves as mysteriously as he arrived.
"See that hatch," he says pointing. "Suppose that's where the food comes from. Not exactly a candle-lit dinner, is it? Bet the food's a bit ropey too, 'narmean?"
moaning about permanent lunches
The guardian wanders into the Post Office and stares at the unstaffed counter. "Bleedin' typical." he says, "Doesn't matter what time of day you come, there's never anyone around. Permanent lunch break, that's what it is. Dunno what the world's coming to, I really don't."
"Strewth, I may as well bugger orft to the office canteen." he says, "Maybe by the time I've failed to get a sandwich there'll be someone here. Huh! " He trudges off, muttering to himself.
"Who do you think I am?" he snaps, "A professional safe-cracker? Eh? I haven't got a bloody clue how to open it. Not a clue."
e
The guardian saunters along the bridge towards you. "Go on, jump." he says prodding you in the back. "It's easy, watch..." He leaps off the bridge and hurtles downwards towards the railway tracks. Shortly before the inevitable crunch, you hear him mumble: "Now for the tricky bit..." There is a distant thud and a stifled moan followed by a muttered curse: "Hmm, didn't expect it to be that bleedin' tricky."

The alternating leg trick is no longer sufficient and you now resort to jumping up and down as a means of relieving your feet. Unfortunately, this has the annoying side effect of bruising your head, since the oven is not particularly tall.
An \_incredible explosion_\ rips through the oven, hurling you through the bakery roof at high velocity. Accompanied by assorted kitchen utensils and domestic appliances, you find yourself at the top of your trajectory, high above the village green. Things can only get worse.

More by luck than judgement, your calculations were spot on and you land on top of him, breaking your fall. Dazed and confused, the guardian crawls away making strange gaga noises.

Astonishingly, the postmistress has a weak spot, and dead mice is it. With a raucous shriek of "Goddamn!" she rushes out of the room.
Guess who has just been unfortunate enough to be recognised by Jannedor? Correct: \_You_\ have. Now, given her enormous power and the fact that you are relatively weak, you might think that, at this point, you've more or less had it. Wrong. You have **COMPLETELY** had it. Goodbye.
The first thing that hits you as you walk in is a solid wall of mutual rage blasting from the balcony, where Xam and Jannedor are arguing furiously.
She gropes around vaguely for a while, then stomps off towards the kitchen. kitchen.
The mist clears. You see within the crystal Jannedor coming in from the balcony. She stares in horror at the table, bereft of the crystal ball, then begins a frantic search of the Castle. She ends up in the Great Hall, where she glances at

 It is spick-and-span.
The withered greenish claw of Jannedor, like a pallid snake, appears and writhes questingly around the chimney.
^Suddenly, the snake-like claw strikes. You are dragged from your hiding-place to confront the enraged Jannedor.  Just as you are beginning to think that your luck has completely run out and it's all over for you, your luck completely runs out and it's all over for you.

which crashes to the floor. Oil spills from the burning lamp and the room is soon engulfed in flames. Hearing the noise, the clockmaker returns to his workshop and, confronted by a wall of flame, he shrieks in horror and runs towards the door. Flinging it open, he hobbles off at high speed towards the village green.
The clockmaker looks towards the window and sees you. He rushes across the room shouting  traditional Yiddish obscenities and closes the window shut.
"Alright, already," moans a voice from inside the shop. "I'm coming, I'm coming." Through the window you see the clockmaker leave his workshop and shuffle out towards the main shop area.
A key turns in the lock and the door opens. Squinting in the light, the clockmaker complains: "My life, can't you read, my boy? A [notice] I put on the [door], and still they come knocking." He points a shaky finger towards the notice, and slams the [door] in your face. Through the window, you see him enter the back room and resume his work.
"Oi, you," says the publican, "Yes. You. Out. You know what I'm talking about. You're barred. Out."
The old codger is a trifle deaf. He doesn't hear you.
Look. You're not going to like this. You're not going to like it at all. All right. The facts: you put the bracelet on Jannedor's wrist but there weren't enough charms on it so... she got you. Sorry. Let's skip over the details. It's hard to say goodbye, but: Goodbye.  You blew it.
As you clasp the bracelet securely to the probing wrist of Jannedor, an unearthly wail fills the air. The very foundations of the castle seem to tremble beneath your feet. A sudden tremendous roaring fills your ears, like the roar of falling masonry. It is not, however, the roar of falling masonry, but the roar of an inhumanly, abominably, unfairly colossal bus. Your response to this hideous threat to your existence is to stand immobile with your mouth hanging open.

You scramble up the ladder. Nearing the top, you come across a minor problem: there are no rungs to allow further climbing.
 There is no alternative; you climb back down.
From your vantage point atop the stool, you easily reach the rungs. A short climb later you find yourself at the top of the ladder.
As you step from the ladder to the girder, your foot slips sending the ladder crashing to the floor below.
Unfortunately, there's nowhere to go.
The rungs at the bottom of the ladder are missing and you're not high enough to reach them.

Alas, bareback unicorn riding is not possible. You fall off with a thump to the rump.
Firmly seated upon the saddle, you rise into the air with the unicorn, which, after a brief and comfortable flight, settles gently upon the parapet of the Castle. "Welcome to the parapet," you seem to hear it say, "and we hope that you will fly with us again. Have a nice day."

You hear the brakes of the bus screeching, but it is simply too fast to stop in time. You defeated Jannedor, but as it seems everything is going to end here. The driver rather lost control and while turning sideways, the bus keeps sliding irresistibly towards you. Ironically your life will end by crashing into automatic doors, which are not so automatic on this side.~~Right before you crash into the doors, they open. In a quick reflex, you jump into the sliding bus...~~only to recognise that your life will end in the window opposite to the doors.~~Wildly hurtling through the bus, you can see a lot of people smiling at you: a now rather toothless baker, a postmistress hugging a mouse, the stationmaster playing on a harmonica, and a friendly cloud on the driver's seat smiling with the brightest silver lining you can get.~~And while you still try to collect your thoughts and see the window approaching you hear a deafening yell: "No [ticket], no ride! Get off my bus, fare dodger!"~~Before you even understand what is happening and right on your way into the window, the [ticket] inspector grasps an emergency hammer and smashes the window.~~You are lying on the road, everything is hurting and all you want to do now is give the deckchair in your garden a reason to exist. But you're alive! Sometimes fortune honours the brave and the wise. You defeated Jannedor by cleverness, not by luck. Good for you to having had all your luck still with you.~~\**YOU WON!**\ \_Twice!_\  Congratulations!~~Now how about this:

He is probably another Guardian. But he looks pale, almost translucent. You ask him what happened to him. "You want to know what happened to me? My friend, better get a look at yourself." You look down at your [hand]. \_Translucent!_\ You're about to panic, but the old guy interrupts;~~"Yeah, I know, a bit disgusting. I was on my way to rescue you, but I got \_jinxed_\.

Was looking for someone to take over my duties in the house for quite some time. You know, slamming doors, shaking chairs, creepy noises, and all that stuff. Now I can finally retire."~~Perhaps it wasn't your life's dream, but it could have been worse (not much though). You'll soon get used to it! But what \_really_\ counts is...~~\**YOU WON!**\ You defeated Jannedor and almost survived the bus. Congratulations!~~Not satisfied? So, how about this:
